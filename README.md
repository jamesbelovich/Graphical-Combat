The goal for this project is to build on the text-based conmbat game made earlier in the semester, but making it a version with graphics.
The idea is for the user to select a base character and be able to fight a randomly generated enemy.
Winning the fight upgrades the user's selected character, and resets health after each fight, win or lose.
The technology and techniques stem from pygame, simpleGE, and a slightly altered tbc module to make it appear on screen instead of in the shell.
All background, sfx, and sprites come from opengameart.org.
Process
  I learned how to get specific sprites out of a sprite sheet
  I got stuck while placing the sprites, failed to making the GUI elements look decent, and trying to make the sound not overbearing. I could not find out why the intro scene places the sprites off the bottom right corner if a character button was clicked more than once and I could not find out how to make multilabels transparent so much of the text on screen is overwhelming and simply is not aesthetically pleasing.
  I could improve by planning out steps to accomplish in an extended time frame instead of cramming most of it into a couple days. This could have helped give me more time to solve my issues.
  I would change my process by starting and planning my game idea sooner
  My Game Design Documemnt and end result are very similar but I did not include a dodge feature.
  Staying on track was simple as much of the intitial concept was already set for me due to being part of an earlier project.
