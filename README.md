The goal for this project is to build on the text-based conmbat game made earlier in the semester, but making it a version with graphics.
The idea is for the user to select a base character and be able to fight a randomly generated character.
Winning the fight ideally upgrades the user's character and increasingly difficult enemies.
The technology and techniques stem from pygame, simpleGE, and a slightly altered tbc module to make it appear on screen instead of in the shell
All background, sfx, and sprites come from opengameart.org
Process
  I learned how to get specific sprites out of a sprite sheet
  I got stuck while sizing and placing the sprites, making the GUI elements look decent, and trying to make the sound not overbearing
  I could improve by planning out steps to accomplish in an extended time frame instead of cramming most of it into a couple days
  I would change my process by starting and planning my game idea sooner
  My Game Design Documemnt and end result are very similar but I did not include a dodge feature
  Staying on track was simple as much of the intitial concept was already set for me due to being part of an earlier project
